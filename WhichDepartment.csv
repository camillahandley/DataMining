"I am writing because as a client of Bank of America, N.A. they claim to be able to have the right to foreclose by the California Declaration ( Civ. Code 2923.55 ( b ) ( 2 ) ). Their reason for this decision in the letter happened because they have already contacted the borrower to assess the borrowers financial situation and to explore options for the borrower to avoid foreclosure in accordance with the California Declaration ( Civ. Code 2923.55 ( b ) ( 2 ) ). However, prior to this letter I, the client, XXXX XXXX XXXX have sent out three previous Request for Mortgage Assistance Applications to Bank of America, N.A. in the result of having the only option to Short Sale. These Request for Mortgage Assistances which I have sent out in the past have also contained all of my contact information needed to be able to discuss the matters on my current finances, which concludes that there is no excuse to the absent amount of information needed to contact me on such matters. To conclude, the letter of California Declaration ( Civ. Code 2923.55 ( b ) ( 2 ) ) is in short, void because Bank of America, N.A. was able to make initial contact with me and explore more options with me, XXXX XXXX XXXX from the time I sent out the first Request for Mortgage Assistance. 

Also, the California Declaration ( Civ. Code 2923.55 ( b ) ( 2 ) ) they used was signed and dated on XX/XX/2019, which can not be used for my current Notice of Default which is dated XX/XX/2019. Therefore meaning, that both documents together are not legal and are void to continue forth with the procedures of foreclosure."

"Equifax keeps reporting accounts that are in someone else name and social security number. The following items on the enclosed PDF file are not mine. There is an alternate social that Equifax keeps reporting and can not get it through their head that the alternate social being reported IS NOT MINE and all the creditors have verified this and told me they removed the item, but yet Equifax continues to report it. I have enclosed a printout of the items, every item in YELLOW is NOT MINE, also a copy of the latest three police reports filed. The two addresses in yellow are not mine either. XXXX said they would remove it, XXXX XXXX sent a letter to remove it and yet they appear still on my report."
"Wells Fargo refuses to respond to my previous complaint, which was number XXXX. The complaint was sent to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. Currently, there is an auction date of XX/XX/XXXX, and Wells Fargo has not responded to my attorney 's calls. We have been attempting to resolve the pending issue regarding the loan modification approval. I have submitted all documents that Wells Fargo has requested in order to move forward with assuming the existing loan on the subject property ; however, Wells Fargo refuses to cooperate to resolve the issue regarding the approval of the loan modification. Furthermore, Wells Fargo has specified that they do not have to communicate with any of their clients whatsoever. We have been trying to negotiate with Wells Fargo, before they file bankruptcy, and leave their clients in limbo. We are ready to begin making mortgage payments in order to settle the debt on the subject property, but Wells Fargo appears to be very stubborn. The California Attorney General 's office needs to continue investigating this fraudulent and unethical company that has been continuously taking advantage of homeowners. My family and I are ready to resolve this issue, and Wells Fargo needs to negotiate in order to settle this dispute. Finally, there is no unauthorized third party regarding this pending matter. Wells Fargo needs to stop creating fantasies, and deal with this dispute in a sound and reasonable capacity."
"This complaint is about Chase Bank. I recieved an over draft this morning for {$150.00}. According to the Chase app. I had {$40.00} in my account as of yesterday, XX/XX/2019, when i withdraw {$120.00} out at the atm. I tried to figure out how this could have happen but only thing i see is my payment to XXXX XXXX for {$200.00} that was placed on friday XX/XX/2019. Now i know for a fact that it was posted to my account which means the money was to be held or taken out. Because the {$200.00} was on the XXXX XXXX credit card the next day. I do not understand how i overdraft my account when i always check my app. I just found out My daughter who is XXXX  XXXX  is also having this problem. She has a hard time counting her money and she said this has happened to her more then once."
"Kinum, Inc. ignored my letter ( sent to them within 5 days of their initial communication ) asking them to substantiate their claim that I owed debt. They falsely accused me of owing debt, distorting facts and misrepresenting an agreement I had with a vendor. I sent the letter by certified mail, asking for substantiation of the debt and asking for proof that they had a right to collect it. I know they received it because their employee signed the certified mail receipt. Before responding to me, they contacted my relatives and terrified them. They also contacted me and claimed they never got the letter even though I have signature proof."
"XXXX XXXX Navient Office of the Customer Advocate XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX Account # XXXX RE : Income-based repayment plans Account # XXXX Good day, I have received my new IBR payment information, and wish to inform you that you have miscalculated. Last years XXXX income-based repayment amount was XXXX and based on my salary of {$65000.00}. This year, you have raised the supposedly income-based repayment up to {$710.00}? The increase seems excessive, as based on the 10 % of gross income formula the correct amount would be much closer to {$590.00}. 

Your company has deliberately withheld the necessary information for getting that recalculation done for MONTHS, ignored my letter to do so and ample information regarding my current income, and continued to overcharge me. I am including a new IBR request and a copy of a recent paycheck. You will IMMEDIATELY recalculate my IBR based on my actual income, as you have been asked to do multiple times over the last few months. 

I live in XXXX, which currently has one of the highest costs of living in the nation, and can not be expected to sit by quietly while you take more than your due. I have never missed a payment to anyone who has held my loans ( including XXXX XXXX, who dispersed my loans to debt collectors rather than obey the laws regarding IBR ), and except for a few brief deferments have been paying steadily since the year XXXX. I would like to know when I might reasonably expect loan forgiveness from Navient, as it is usually offered after 20-25 years. 

And, by law, you only have a right to only 15 % of my DISCRETIONARY income ( which amounts to approximately $ XXXXmonth after expenses ), and NOT 15 % or greater of my gross income, you will abide by the law, and immediately adjust the IBR amount down to the expected amount. I am happy to provide receipts as required to prove the amount of my discretionary income.

Kindly respond in writing, so that I may share your answer with all those I have Ccd on this letter. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and its rapid resolution."
